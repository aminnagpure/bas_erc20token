- There will be a fixed supply of our tokens
- The token sale will last one month
- When a user buys our token they will recieve - 1ETH = 500 of our token
   - Week 1 - they will recieve 25% bonus
   - Week 2 - they will revieve 15% bonus
   - Week 3 - They will recieve 10% bonus
   - Week 4 - they will recieve no bonus.

- I want to be able to set the start & stop date for the token sale
- If the number of tokens are sold before the end date, then the token sale should end
- Contract must have an admin, which is hard-coded as an ETH address
- Admin has 30% of all supply of coins and the 70% will be distributed in the coin sale.
- Admin can generate a list of all users and show number of tokens they have
- Admin can pull everyone's or individual coins, setting their value = 0 incase of an emergency
- Needs to be very secure

We will also need to be able to display the statistics on our landing page for this Token Sale/ICO. We will design this just need to show: 
- Tokens sold in real-time - So for example we have 1million tokens there needs to be some sort of countdown showing how many are left.
